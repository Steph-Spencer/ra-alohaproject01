This is the repository for project 1A in the RED Academy Web Developer Professional program.

The project is a basic web page made with HTML5 and CSS3 for the fictional Aloha Apparel Company. It contains a banner with the site heading and hero image, a call to action, a selection of products, an email signup form, as well as a footer with social media icons.

The code is messier than I would like and I still want to take the time to tidy up and streamline code.
