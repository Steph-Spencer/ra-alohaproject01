This is the repository for project 1 at RED Academy

Not working:
-banner lady is not properly responsive. I missed a trick on this, have experimented with methods to make her work, but ran out of time.
-social icons in footer do not position properly in responsive views. Wanted them to be in a line horizontally below the text, but ran out of time to troubleshoot the positioning
-white space between Sign Up section and is not optimal on many screen size, where it expands larger than intended.
-wanted to find a way to change background in Signup section so that text is more legible over darker portions of image.
-code files are messier than I would like. Ran out of time to tidy up and streamline code.
-Tried @import for Google Fonts but was not able to get it to work, so reverted to old method until I can obtain some help on troubleshooting this.
